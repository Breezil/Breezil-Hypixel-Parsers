# WoolGames

The WoolGames module exposes a single parser, `parseWoolGames`, which mirrors the raw `stats.WoolGames` block of the Hypixel player API field-for-field into readonly, fully-typed objects. Every value below is read straight from the raw JSON with no computation, no ratios, and no derived totals. WoolGames bundles several sub-games, including the now-retired legacy Sheep Wars and Capture the Wool, whose blocks are still typed here because old players retain that data.

## parseWoolGames

Parses a player's WoolGames stats (`stats.WoolGames`) into a typed object.

```ts
function parseWoolGames(block: Record<string, unknown>): WoolGamesStats | null;
```

### Null / empty behavior

`parseWoolGames` returns `null` when the raw block has no keys (empty or absent). Otherwise it returns a fully-populated `WoolGamesStats` object, with missing values filled in by the safe readers used throughout the module:

- Missing or non-number values become `0`.
- Missing or non-string values become `""`.
- Boolean fields are `true` only when the raw value is exactly `true`, otherwise `false`.
- Missing nested objects are treated as empty objects, so every nested block is still present and populated with the defaults above.
- String-array fields (`packages`) become empty arrays (`[]`) when absent.
- `Date | null` fields are `null` when the raw value is absent or not a positive epoch-ms number.

The dynamic maps (`woolWars.classes`, `woolWars.tourney`, `woolWars.layouts`, `sheepWars.layout.slot`, `captureTheWool.layout`) contain only the keys present in the raw data, so they may be empty objects when no data exists.
