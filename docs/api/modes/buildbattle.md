# Build Battle

The Build Battle module exposes a single parser, `parseBuildBattle`, which mirrors the raw `stats.BuildBattle` block of the Hypixel player API field-for-field into readonly, fully-typed objects. Every value below is read straight from the raw JSON with no computation, no ratios, and no derived totals.

## parseBuildBattle

Parses a player's Build Battle stats (`stats.BuildBattle`) into a typed object.

```ts
function parseBuildBattle(
  stats: Record<string, unknown>,
): BuildBattleStats | null;
```

### Null / empty behavior

`parseBuildBattle` returns `null` when `stats.BuildBattle` is missing or is not a plain object (i.e. it is absent, `null`, or an array). Otherwise it returns a fully-populated `BuildBattleStats` object; every field below is always present. Missing fields are filled in by the safe readers used throughout the module:

- Missing or non-number values become `0`.
- Missing or non-string values become `""`.
- Boolean fields are `true` only when the raw value is exactly `true`, otherwise `false`.
- Missing nested objects are treated as empty objects, so every nested block is still present and populated with the defaults above.
- String-array fields become empty arrays (`[]`) when absent, and keep only the string entries of the raw array.
- `Date | null` fields are `null` when the raw value is absent or not a positive epoch-ms number.

The dynamic record fields (`votesByTheme`, `votesReceived`, `backdropWins`) contain only the keys present in the raw data, so they may be empty objects when no data exists.
