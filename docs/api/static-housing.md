# Static & Housing

The static module exposes parsers for Hypixel's network-wide endpoints (`/boosters`, `/leaderboards`, `/counts`, `/punishmentstats`), and the housing module parses the `/housing/*` endpoints. Each parser mirrors the raw JSON field-for-field into readonly, fully-typed objects with no computation and no derived totals. Across all parsers the safe readers apply: missing or non-number values become `0`, missing or non-string values become `""`, boolean fields are `true` only when the raw value is exactly `true`, missing nested objects are treated as empty objects, and `Date | null` fields are `null` unless the raw value is a positive epoch-ms number.

## parseBoosters

Parses the network boosters (`/boosters`) into an array of typed objects.

```ts
function parseBoosters(boosters: unknown[]): StaticBooster[];
```

### Null / empty behavior

Never returns `null`. Iterates the input array, skipping any entry that is not a plain object (`null`, arrays, and non-objects are dropped), so the result may be shorter than the input. Returns `[]` when no valid entries exist.

## parseLeaderboards

Parses the leaderboards (`/leaderboards`) into a typed object keyed by game name.

```ts
function parseLeaderboards(
  raw: Record<string, unknown>,
): Record<string, StaticLeaderboard[]>;
```

### Null / empty behavior

Never returns `null`. Reads the raw `leaderboards` object (empty when absent). Each game whose value is not an array is skipped; within a game, non-object entries are skipped. Returns an empty record when no games qualify.

## parseGameCounts

Parses the player counts (`/counts`) into a typed object.

```ts
function parseGameCounts(raw: Record<string, unknown>): StaticGameCounts;
```

### Null / empty behavior

Never returns `null`. Reads the raw `games` object (empty when absent); each game value that is not a plain object is skipped. Per-game `modes` includes only entries whose count is a number.

## parseWatchdogStats

Parses the punishment stats (`/punishmentstats`) into a typed object.

```ts
function parseWatchdogStats(raw: Record<string, unknown>): StaticWatchdogStats;
```

### Null / empty behavior

Never returns `null`. Always returns a fully-populated `StaticWatchdogStats`; missing numeric fields become `0`.

## parseHouse

Parses a single house (`/housing/house`) into a typed object.

```ts
function parseHouse(raw: Record<string, unknown>): HousingHouse;
```

### Null / empty behavior

Never returns `null`. Always returns a fully-populated `HousingHouse`; `createdAt` is a `Date` or `null`, and the nested `cookies` object is always present.

## parseHouses

Parses a list of houses (`/housing/houses`) into an array of typed objects.

```ts
function parseHouses(houses: unknown[]): HousingHouse[];
```

### Null / empty behavior

Never returns `null`. Iterates the input array, skipping any entry that is not a plain object; each remaining entry is parsed via `parseHouse`. Returns `[]` when no valid entries exist.
