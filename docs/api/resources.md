# Resources

The resources module exposes parsers for Hypixel's static `/resources/*` registries, mirroring each raw registry field-for-field into readonly, fully-typed objects. Every value below is read straight from the raw JSON with no computation and no derived totals. Across all parsers the safe readers apply: missing or non-number values become `0`, missing or non-string values become `""`, boolean fields are `true` only when the raw value is exactly `true`, missing nested objects are treated as empty objects, and `Date | null` fields are `null` unless the raw value is a positive epoch-ms number.

## parseAchievements

Parses the achievement registry (`/resources/achievements`) into a typed object keyed by game name.

```ts
function parseAchievements(
  achievements: Record<string, unknown>,
): Record<string, AchievementsGame>;
```

### Null / empty behavior

Never returns `null`. Iterates every top-level game key in the raw object; each game value is coerced to an object (non-objects become `{}`) and parsed. The `one_time` and `tiered` raw maps populate the `oneTime` and `tiered` records, which are empty objects when absent. The returned top-level record is empty when the raw object has no keys.

## parseChallenges

Parses the challenge registry (`/resources/challenges`) into a typed object keyed by game name.

```ts
function parseChallenges(
  challenges: Record<string, unknown>,
): Record<string, readonly ResourceChallenge[]>;
```

### Null / empty behavior

Never returns `null`. The raw input is coerced to an object (non-objects become `{}`). Each game value is coerced to an array (non-arrays become `[]`) and mapped to `ResourceChallenge` entries; per-challenge `rewards` likewise become `[]` when absent.

## parseQuests

Parses the quest registry (`/resources/quests`) into a typed object keyed by game name.

```ts
function parseQuests(
  quests: Record<string, unknown>,
): Record<string, ResourceQuest[]>;
```

### Null / empty behavior

Never returns `null`. Iterates every top-level game key; each game value is coerced to an array (non-arrays become `[]`) and mapped to `ResourceQuest` entries. Per-quest `rewards`, `objectives`, and `requirements` become `[]` when absent.

## parseGuildAchievements

Parses the guild achievement registry (`/resources/guilds/achievements`) into a typed object.

```ts
function parseGuildAchievements(
  raw: Record<string, unknown>,
): GuildAchievements | null;
```

### Null / empty behavior

Returns `null` when the raw input is not a plain object (i.e. it is `null`, an array, or a non-object). Otherwise returns a fully-populated `GuildAchievements`. The `one_time` and `tiered` raw maps populate the `oneTime` and `tiered` records, which are empty objects when absent. `lastUpdated` is a `Date` or `null`.

## parseGames

Parses the game registry (`/resources/games`) into a typed object keyed by game key.

```ts
function parseGames(
  games: Record<string, unknown>,
): Readonly<Record<string, GameDefinition>>;
```

### Null / empty behavior

Never returns `null`. Iterates every top-level key; each game value is coerced to an object (non-objects become `{}`). Per-game `modeNames` is read into a record of string values, empty when absent.

## parseVanityPets

Parses the vanity pet registry (`/resources/vanity/pets`) into a typed object.

```ts
function parseVanityPets(data: Record<string, unknown>): VanityResource;
```

### Null / empty behavior

Never returns `null`. The raw `types` and `rarities` are each read only when they are arrays (otherwise `[]`); non-object array entries are filtered out before mapping.

## parseVanityCompanions

Parses the vanity companion registry (`/resources/vanity/companions`) into a typed object. Identical shape and behavior to `parseVanityPets`.

```ts
function parseVanityCompanions(data: Record<string, unknown>): VanityResource;
```
