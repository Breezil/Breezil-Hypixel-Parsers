# SkyBlock Profile

The SkyBlock parsers turn the raw `/skyblock/profile` and `/skyblock/profiles` Hypixel API JSON into readonly, fully-typed objects. They are strict-raw: fields are mirrored from the API one-for-one, with no derived, computed, or aggregated values. Every value is read straight from the raw JSON.

This page documents every export of `src/skyblock.ts`: both parse functions and the complete tree of interfaces and types they return. It is exhaustive by design and therefore long.

## parseSkyBlockProfile

Parses a single SkyBlock profile (`/skyblock/profile`) into a typed object.

```ts
export function parseSkyBlockProfile(
  profile: Record<string, unknown>,
  forUuid?: string,
): SkyBlockProfile | null;
```

Returns `null` when `profile` is not a non-array object. When `forUuid` is supplied, the matching member is resolved into the `member` field (or `null` if that uuid is not present in `members`); when `forUuid` is omitted, `member` is always `null`. The full `members` map is populated regardless, keyed by player uuid.

## parseSkyBlockProfiles

Parses a player's SkyBlock profiles (`/skyblock/profiles`) into a typed object.

```ts
export function parseSkyBlockProfiles(
  data: Record<string, unknown>,
  forUuid?: string,
): readonly SkyBlockProfile[];
```

Reads `data.profiles`. Returns an empty array when `data.profiles` is not an array. Each array entry is parsed via `parseSkyBlockProfile` (with the same `forUuid` semantics); non-object entries and any entry that parses to `null` are filtered out. Every element of the result is a [`SkyBlockProfile`](#skyblockprofile).

### Null / empty behavior

Both parsers populate every field of every returned object using the safe readers shared across the library:

- Missing or non-number values become `0`.
- Missing or non-string values become `""`.
- Boolean fields are `true` only when the raw value is exactly `true`, otherwise `false`.
- Missing nested objects are treated as empty objects, so every nested block is always present and populated with the defaults above.
- String-array, number-array, and object-array fields become empty arrays (`[]`) when absent, and silently drop entries of the wrong element type.
- `Date | null` fields are `null` when the raw value is absent or not a positive epoch-ms number.
- Dynamic record fields (`Record<string, ...>`) contain only the keys present in the raw data, and so may be empty objects.
- Inventory fields decode a base64/gzip NBT blob; they are `null` when the underlying `data` string is missing or empty.

## Returned type tree

### SkyBlockProfile

The root object returned by `parseSkyBlockProfile`.

```ts
interface SkyBlockProfile {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly cuteName: string;
  readonly gameMode: string;
  readonly selected: boolean;
  readonly createdAt: Date | null;
  readonly banking: SkyBlockBanking;
  readonly communityUpgrades: SkyBlockCommunityUpgrades;
  readonly member: SkyBlockMember | null;
  readonly members: Record<string, SkyBlockMember>;
}
```

| Field       | Notes                                                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`        | Raw `profile_id`.                                                          |
| `cuteName`  | Raw `cute_name` (e.g. "Apple", "Banana").                                  |
| `gameMode`  | Raw `game_mode` (e.g. "ironman", "island", "bingo"; `""` for normal).      |
| `createdAt` | Raw `created_at` epoch-ms as `Date`, or `null`.                            |
| `member`    | The member resolved from `forUuid`, or `null`. See parser semantics above. |
| `members`   | Every member keyed by player uuid.                                         |

### SkyBlockBanking

Profile co-op bank. Read from raw `banking`.

```ts

}
```

### SkyBlockBankTransaction

```ts
interface SkyBlockBankTransaction {
  readonly amount: number;
  readonly timestamp: number;

Read from raw `community_upgrades`.

```ts
interface SkyBlockCommunityUpgrades {
  readonly currentlyUpgrading: SkyBlockCommunityUpgradeInProgress | null;

```

`currentlyUpgrading` is `null` when the raw `currently_upgrading` is absent or not an object.

### SkyBlockCommunityUpgradeInProgress

```ts
interface SkyBlockCommunityUpgradeInProgress {
  readonly upgrade: string;
  readonly newTier: number;

## Shared types

These types appear throughout the member tree.

### SkyBlockScalarMap

An open record of scalar values; entries of other types are dropped.

```ts
type SkyBlockScalarMap = Record<string, number | string | boolean>;
```

### SkyBlockInventory

A decoded inventory. `data` is a base64/gzip NBT blob in the raw API; it is decoded into the typed `items` array. The field is `null` (at every usage site) when the raw blob is missing or empty.

```ts
interface SkyBlockInventory {
  readonly type: number;
  readonly items: readonly NbtItem[];
}
```

`NbtItem` is documented on the [NBT page](../nbt). `type` reads the raw inventory `type` discriminator.

### SkyBlockItemBytes

A raw, undecoded item blob — kept as a string rather than decoded. Used where the API stores arrays of item bytes (e.g. toolkits).

```ts
interface SkyBlockItemBytes {
  readonly type: number;
  readonly data: string;
}
```

### SkyBlockToolkit

A garden/foraging toolkit. `inUse` maps a toolkit slot group to per-tool booleans; `tools` maps each tool key to its raw item-byte blobs. The `IN_USE` and `IS_UNLOCKED` keys are excluded from `tools`.

```ts
interface SkyBlockToolkit {
  readonly isUnlocked: boolean;
  readonly inUse: Record<string, Record<string, boolean>>;
  readonly tools: Record<string, readonly SkyBlockItemBytes[]>;
}
```

---

## Currencies & fairy souls

### SkyBlockCurrencies

Read from raw `currencies`. `essences` maps each essence type to its `current` amount.

```ts
interface SkyBlockCurrencies {
  readonly coinPurse: number;
  readonly motesPurse: number;
  readonly essences: SkyBlockEssences;
}
```

`coinPurse` reads `coin_purse`; `motesPurse` reads `motes_purse`.

### SkyBlockEssences

```ts
type SkyBlockEssences = Record<string, number>;
```

### SkyBlockFairySouls

Read from raw `fairy_soul`.

```ts
interface SkyBlockFairySouls {
  readonly exchanges: number;
  readonly collected: number;
  readonly unspent: number;
}
```

`exchanges` reads `fairy_exchanges`; `collected` reads `total_collected`; `unspent` reads `unspent_souls`.

---

## Leveling

### SkyBlockLeveling

SkyBlock Level / task progression. Read from raw `leveling`.

  readonly bankAccount: number;
  readonly hasCookieBuff: boolean;
  readonly coopInvitation: SkyBlockCoopInvitation | null;
}
```

`firstJoin` is an epoch-ms `Date` or `null`; `coopInvitation` is `null` when absent.

### SkyBlockCoopInvitation

```ts
interface SkyBlockCoopInvitation {
  readonly timestamp: number;
  readonly invitedBy: string;
  readonly confirmed: boolean;

  readonly soulflow: number;
  readonly favoriteArrow: string;
  readonly teleporterPillConsumed: boolean;
}
```

---

## Skills

### SkyBlockSkillExperience

Per-skill experience. Read from `player_data.experience` (and also exposed nested inside [SkyBlockPlayerData](#skyblockplayerdata)).

```ts
interface SkyBlockSkillExperience {
  readonly farming: number;

  readonly enchanting: number;
  readonly alchemy: number;
